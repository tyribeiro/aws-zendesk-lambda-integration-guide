## Notes / Original Steps (As Captured)

- create something in zendesk for webhook  
- need lambda set up already in aws  
- add url from api gateway into webhook  
- choose POST method  
- use JSON, send ticket data  
- in lambda, parse event and check ticket fields  
- make sure permissions are ok  
- test by creating a ticket in zendesk  

More scattered notes:

- need to deploy API in API Gateway first  
- 404 error if wrong URL or missing stage  
- use test event in lambda console to test payload  
- might have to enable CORS (not sure)  
- remember to update function code before testing again

## Why This Version Exists

This file mimics what **raw SME notes** or **working documentation** might look like before a Technical Editor reviews it. It contains:

- Incomplete sentences  
- Inconsistent capitalization  
- Missing context and preconditions  
- Unclear sequencing of steps  
- No explicit audience or assumptions  

The **edited version** in `03-setup-instructions-after.md` demonstrates how I transform this into **clear, globally readable, and technically accurate content**.
