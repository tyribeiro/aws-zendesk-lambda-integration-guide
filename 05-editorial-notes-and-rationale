# Editorial Notes and Rationale

This document explains the editorial decisions I made while transforming raw integration notes into clear, globally accessible technical documentation.

It reflects how I would think and work as a **Certification Technical Editor** for AWS.

## 1. Copyediting and Proofreading

Key changes included:

- Correcting spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
- Converting fragments into complete, clear sentences.
- Standardizing capitalization and naming of services (for example, always “Amazon API Gateway”, “AWS Lambda”).

**Example:**

- Original: `create something in zendesk for webhook`  
- Edited: `Create a new Webhook in Zendesk to send events to the Amazon API Gateway endpoint.`

## 2. Substantive and Developmental Editing

I reorganized the content to follow a logical, task-based flow:

1. Prerequisites  
2. Lambda configuration  
3. API Gateway endpoint  
4. Zendesk Webhook  
5. Zendesk Trigger  
6. Testing and troubleshooting

This makes it easier for a reader to:
- Understand the dependencies between components
- Follow the steps without missing a prerequisite
- Map the written instructions back to the architecture

---

## 3. Global English and Translatability

I intentionally avoided:

- Idioms and slang (for example, “a bunch of servers”, “stuff happens here”).
- Region-specific phrasing that may not translate well.

Instead, I used:

- Short, direct sentences.
- Clear subject–verb–object structures.
- Consistent technical terminology.

This aligns with the requirement in the job posting to:
- “Edit content to meet global English standards”
- “Ensure exam content is clear, inclusive, and fair for a diverse global audience”

---

## 4. Inclusivity and Fairness

While this documentation is not itself an exam, I still applied fairness principles:

- Described technical issues neutrally, avoiding blame.
- Made instructions accessible to readers who may not be native English speakers.
- Focused on observable symptoms and actionable resolutions.

These approaches directly support the **legal defensibility and fairness** needed in high-stakes certification content.

## 5. Alignment with Assessment and Certification Work

Throughout the editing process, I considered:

- How this integration scenario could be turned into **exam questions**:
  - “Which AWS service…”
  - “What is the most likely cause of…”
  - “Which configuration change resolves…”
- How wording choices affect:
  - The clarity of the scenario
  - The plausibility of distractors
  - The difficulty level of an item

This editorial mindset is the same one I would apply when editing:
- **Exam questions**
- **Exam guides**
- **Practice exam content**
