# AI-Assisted Editing Workflow (Responsible Use)

This document describes how I would incorporate **AI/ML tools** into the editorial process for technical content, especially in a certification context.

---

## Goals

- Increase **editorial throughput** without sacrificing quality
- Maintain or improve **clarity**, **consistency**, and **global English** compliance
- Protect the **technical accuracy** and **legal defensibility** of certification materials

---

## Appropriate Uses of AI/ML in Editing

I would use AI tools to:

- Suggest alternative phrasings for long or complex sentences
- Identify potential grammar and punctuation issues
- Propose consistent terminology or formatting patterns
- Generate initial drafts of checklists or summaries, which I then refine
- Highlight possible ambiguity or unclear pronoun references

In all cases, I treat AI outputs as **suggestions**, not as final content.

---

## What AI Should *Not* Decide

I would not rely on AI tools to:

- Validate the **technical correctness** of an explanation
- Determine which answer in an exam question is correct
- Approve final wording for high-stakes items
- Make decisions about **item difficulty** or **item discrimination**

Those responsibilities must remain with human subject-matter experts, psychometricians, and editors.

## Guardrails for Certification Context

To support the integrity of AWS Certification exams, I would:

- Always review AI-generated text for:
  - Technical accuracy
  - Alignment with AWS style and brand
  - Fairness and bias
  - Global English standards
- Ensure that any AI-assisted workflow is:
  - **Documented**
  - **Repeatable**
  - **Auditable**

## Example AI-Assisted Workflow

1. Start with a SME’s raw notes or a rough exam item.
2. Manually clarify the structure and confirm the intended technical meaning.
3. Use an AI tool to suggest:
   - A clearer version of a complex sentence
   - Alternative wording for answer options
4. Review all AI suggestions:
   - Reject anything that changes the technical meaning
   - Accept or adapt wording that improves clarity or readability
5. Perform a final human pass for:
   - Technical precision
   - Exam fairness
   - Style and branding
