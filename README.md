# AWS x Zendesk Integration – Technical Editing Case Study

This repository showcases my work as a **technical editor and technical content designer** for an integration between **AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and Zendesk webhooks**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how I:
- Transform raw technical implementation notes into **clear, concise, and globally understandable documentation**
- Apply **copyediting, substantive editing, and developmental editing** to technical content
- Maintain **technical accuracy** while improving **readability and fairness** for a global audience
- Think like an **AWS Certification Technical Editor** when reviewing and refining content

---

## 📌 Context

This integration updates Zendesk tickets using:
- A **Zendesk webhook** calling
- An **Amazon API Gateway endpoint** that triggers
- An **AWS Lambda function**, which then
- Performs logic and updates data in Zendesk

The original instructions existed as fragmented notes and ad-hoc steps.  
This repo contains both the **“before”** and **“after”** versions, plus commentary on my editorial decisions.
